# aes_implementation

Create a C++ program that will encrypt and decrypt a text file.

Implement two different algorithms that can be used independently.

Alternatively, you can implement the AES algorithm without having to create a second algorithm.

The program should run from a Command Line Interface with a simple menu.

Grading:

- The program implements the AES algorithms and successfully encrypts and decrypts a text file. 100%
- The program implements two different algorithms and successfully encrypts and decrypts a text file for both. 95%
- The program implements encryption algorithms but can not successfully encrypt and decrypt a text file for both. 80%
- The program compiles without error but does not completely implement any encryption / decryption algorithms. 65%
- The program does not compile. 50%
- Nothing submitted. 0%
