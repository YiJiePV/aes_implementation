# aes_implementation

Contributors: Karena Qian and Daniel Adebayo

Instructions:
Create a C++ program that will encrypt and decrypt a text file.

Implement two different algorithms that can be used independently.

Alternatively, you can implement the AES algorithm without having to create a second algorithm.

The program should run from a Command Line Interface with a simple menu.
